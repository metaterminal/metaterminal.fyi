This site is created by Thomas Gordon, a kiwi studying computer engineering at Brown University. Online, some people call me <span class="emphasis">metaterminal</span>.

During my studies, I've [designed a CPU](../processor/), built an instrument tuner with an Arduino controller, and helped install an interactive LED screen on Brown's Center for Information Technology building.

Currently, I work part-time at Brown's [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/) as a Research Assistant. My studies help make CCV's computing cluster more cost-effective and climate efficient. 

In my spare time, I [create puzzlehunts](../puzzles/), [write fiction](../fiction/), [host a podcast](https://arguingaboutpuzzles.substack.com/), [help run an annual awards show](https://bravopuzzleawards.com/), and create cool things. (Some of the cool things are on this website!)

## Technical details

This site is run using the static site generator <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, with individual pages written using Markdown, and deployed using Netlify. I don't use a Zola theme or anything like that; any functionality on here, I have implemented myself.

(Should I have used React or some other kind of framework? Perhaps! But I enjoyed creating everything from scratch; implementing new features is fun! I also enjoy how lightweight the end result is.)

This site is entirely static. That means no ads and fast load times. I plan to keep my site like this for as long as I have it up.

I also host the website for the [Bravo Puzzle Awards](https://bravopuzzleawards.com/), which uses an identical tech stack.
