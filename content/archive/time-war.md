At some point in your relative future, usually between April and September 2009, British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking will host an open reception for time travellers.

Though it may be extremely tempting, <b><i>do not go under any circumstances</i></b>.

While it is tempting to ground this with reference to popular culture, media unfortunately tends to change drastically between timelines. Thankfully we are predated by <i>The Time Machine</i>, and thus you should have a basic understanding of a) the concept of time travel by scientific means and b) some of the obvious pitfalls.

Depending on the state of your timeline and your position within it, however, you may not understand the concept of a “time war”.<a class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>If it exists, I found <i>The Changing Men</i> by Fritz Leiber to be pretty instructive.</span></a> The name is evocative, pithy, and extremely misleading. Most likely, you picture field soldiers with time machines; tactics being sent backwards to influence past events; and battles fought between the past and the future.

From a tactical perspective, this situation is more or less impossible. Put it this way: you have a machine which can remove your opponents’ ability to retaliate <i>before they even know they’re fighting you</i>. You can prevent them from ever developing similar technology, embed spies with years of real lived history, and alter any event of which you have sufficient knowledge. You can preempt any countermeasure and correct any mistake. A conflict where either of the combatants has a time machine is always over before it starts. So if a time war is ever taking place, then something, somewhere, has gone horribly horribly wrong.


Currently, a time war is taking place.

If you are reading this, then you (most likely) have been recruited to the cause. We apologize. If you do not wish to partake, then we recommend <i><b>destroying this manual immediately</b></i> and <i><b>never speaking of it to anyone at any point in your life</b></i>. This is (most likely) your last chance to back out. If you keep this manual, but do not follow the instructions within, then there is a very real danger it will cause your death — and possibly the deaths of past or future loved ones.

However, if you have been recruited, then this means that you (most likely) demonstrate the following traits: high level of curiosity, an abundance of caution, sufficient intelligence to understand and act on this manual, and insufficient intelligence to have stopped reading. In all likelihood, your recruiter was a friend, family member, or your future self. Trust their decision. 

Before you follow any instructions, read this manual in its entirety. (That includes all of the appendices. Yes, I know there are over 800 pages. Do it.)

<p align=center><u><b>The nature of the conflict</b></u></p>

Compared to conventional warfare, this is going to sound extremely strange. (A better starting point might be guerilla warfare crossed with clandestine espionage.) It might take you a few days to fully wrap your head around all of this; that is OK. 

Everything stems from one simple and unalterable fact: if an agent has their cover blown at any point, during or after their operation, then that agent is <i>and has always been</i> compromised. 

Consider the following situation. A spy works undercover for 40 years without detection, gathering useful intel, and dies of natural causes without a shred of suspicion upon them. Then, 20 years after their death, a document is unearthed with just enough information for them to be identified. 

That spy, and anything they worked on, is entirely compromised  — from start to end, up and down the timeline. Because their movements can be traced, anyone that spy interacted with is also entirely compromised. The knock-on effect can unravel entire cells, networks, and agencies before they even exist.

In order for a time war to occur long-term (see <u>Theory – Time Dimensionality</u>), then every single agent on both sides must be permanently and constantly deep undercover. There is no statute of limitations. There are no allies. There is no returning home from the front lines. 

Comparisons to the Tsiolkovsky/Fermi/Hart Paradox, and the vicious jungle/dark forest theory, are instructive. There might be hundreds, thousands, even millions of operatives fighting this war all across the world, on either side... and none of us would have any way of knowing.

From now on you must be extremely careful of everything you say and do at all times. Not only that, but you must prevent any and all records of your activities propagating into the future. Once more: <i>it is of utmost importance that no information leaks at any point in your timeline, especially this manual</i>. (See <u>Things to Avoid</u>.) When you take any action, you must consider its implications for every future point in time.

You also cannot — must not — recruit anyone else via face-to-face contact or any kind of traceable communication. (For information about recruiting potential agents, see <u>Techniques – Recruitment</u>).

There is some evidence to suggest that promising potential agents have been eliminated at a young age. This could be predictive; but, more likely, they were discovered at some point during their future lives, and removed from play. 

The good news is that, if you’re alive to read this, then you’ve probably not been compromised.

<br>

<p align=center><u><b>The nature of the enemy</b></u></p>

Simply put, we have absolutely no idea who they are, though we do have an idea of their goals. My personal best guess is that they are an insular, secular, technofascist, highly accelerationist<a class="footnote"><sup>2</sup><span>I don’t know what this means, but I’m leaving it in during this rewrite in case it means something to you.</span></a> organization, with agents embedded at high levels of power.

Preferred vectors of attack seem to be nuclear detonations (with MAD sometimes observed), widespread plagues, accelerated ecological collapse, or any other potential mass-death scenarios. While global warming/climate change is occasionally a useful tool, it does not seem to be solely their fault. (That’s on us as a species.)

We have confirmed that our enemy is none of the following groups:
- The government of the United States
- The government of the USSR / USREA
- The Chinese Communist Party
- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or timeline-equivalents)
- The European Pact (or timeline-equivalents)
- CERN (or timeline-equivalents)
- Any corporation founded after 1956

ADDENDUM: Some agents of the enemy have been successfully identified and eliminated.

<p align=center><u><b>The nature of this manual</b></u></p>

As much as we would like to be a cool secret time travel agency with a <i>How To</i> Guide To Time Travel, this is not one of those. This is, instead, a communally updated and edited document, which has been manually reviewed and disseminated by successive owners.<a class="footnote"><sup>3</sup><span>Hence, I assume, the changes in vocabulary level, tone, and pronoun usage.</span></a> Kind of like a Wikipedia page!<a class="footnote"><sup>4</sup><span>I don’t know what this means either.</span></a>

Not accounting for duplicates and branches, you are the <b>23rd person</b> to receive a version of this manual.

The cover page is designed to encourage readership from intended targets, and reinforce the fact that you should not go to that stupid time travel party, you stupid fucks.

If you make edits to this manual, we recommend it to be typeset in standard American English. (See <u>Appendix A: Updating This Manual</u>.) We <i>highly</i> recommend adding sections or appendices to cover key information that is absent. Also, make sure to update Appendix B if you observe anything new. 

<br>

<p align=center><u><b>The nature of time travel</b></u></p>

There are two broad schools of thought about time travel among non-travelers. The first is that, if time travel is possible, then your travel is already written into history; it is not possible for you to change anything. Everything is predestined. You exist in a closed loop. If you meet yourself in the timeline, you will eventually become them. You cannot kill your own grandfather.

The second is, of course, that change is possible. You can kill not only your grandfather, but also your past self without any difficulties — because if you travel back in time and meet your past self, you’ve just created a clone.

In reality, time travel is both. Changing the past is absolutely, certainly possible (as even the tiniest amount of experimentation will demonstrate.) Chaos theory is dominant here; small alterations can have huge impacts on long-term outcomes.

However, with a certain level of setup, you can ensure that objects remain <i>causally stable</i>; modifications made to a current object will be reflected in the future object from the point of its arrival.<a class="footnote"><sup>5</sup><span>Since I didn’t understand this as written: if you break the handle off a mug, the future version will have arrived broken, before you break it. No <i>Spaceman From Pluto</i> magic.</span></a> (Our working theory is that this is just equivalent to a series of “divergent” timelines continuing until they settle into a deterministic, stable loop. See <u>Techniques – Causally Stable Loops</u>.)

This can be done with people.

<p align=center><u><b>Travel basics</b></u></p>

This guide is maximally helpful for those between the early ‘60s and the late ‘00s. If you somehow received this further into the 21st century, then congratulations! Your timeline has made it pretty far. We leave it up to your judgement as to whether the war is still in operation, and what you need to do about it.

In the case that the theatre of war shifts primarily into the 21st century, then much of this manual will need to be significantly revised and extended. 

(UPDATE: Seems some of us are indeed operating as late as 2018. I’ve already included some basic 21st century tips from my own personal experience, but this timeline is going to get imminently reset anyway, so if you ever make it as far out as me, you have some legwork to do.)

The classic argument against the existence of time travel is the fact that it has not always existed. Hopefully, information we’ve already covered has answered at least some of this. The rest is down to a fairly simple fact: <i>the distance your time machine can travel backwards is approximately proportional to the log of the transistor density on its integrated circuit</i>. 

<p align=center><b>-Δt ≈ ln(ρ<sub><sub>transistor</sub></sub>) - μ</b></p>

Which is to say: the further into the timeline you are, the further backwards you can travel. As a general shorthand, take your current year, subtract 1964, and multiply by 1.15; this is the maximum number of years you can travel backwards. Unless you’re fairly far forward in time, you probably won’t be crossing the 1960 mark.

(See <u>Theory – Travel Curves</u> for more math I worked out on this.)

Some deep-range research loops suggest this rule of thumb breaks down around 2030.<a class="footnote"><sup>6</sup><span>Surveys suggest that the Moore Plateau interferes at this point, although there must be a limiting factor that inhibits leapfrogging. (See <u>Techniques - Leapfrogging</u>.)</span></a> No travel before 1954 has been recorded.

Forward travel is not possible. You have to go the slow way.

<br>

<p align=center><u><b>First steps</b></u></p>

- Ensure the security of this manual

If you read it in a public place, then your <b>immediate first priority</b> is to correct that. (See <u>Gaining Access to Time Travel</u> and <u>Techniques – Corrections</u>.)

Otherwise, you should be OK. Keep it in a place where it will not be discovered by others; if you are under the age of 18, this might be a little difficult. Recommendations: in heating vents, in the drywall, inside elevator doors. Dumpsters, basements, and under your mattress are all bad ideas.

Do NOT allow this manual to leak. This is our one and only weapon. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but: <b>DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE UNLESS YOU ARE FOLLOWING PROPER RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES. DO NOT SHOW FRIENDS AND FAMILY. DO NOT LEAVE IT LYING AROUND THE HOUSE. DO NOT SHARE IT ON THE ARPANET. DO NOT BURY IT SOMEWHERE. DO NOT LEAVE IT ON A LIBRARY SHELF. DO NOT PUT IT IN A STORAGE LOCKER AND THEN LET THE LOCKER GO TO AUCTION.</b> (Please add to this list as future cases come up.)

Make sure that, if you die, this manual will not propagate outside of your control. (Suggested strategies include: memorization and immediate destruction; a dead man’s switch; mixing it with other key personal documents in a large box and stipulating the destruction of the box and its contents in your will.)

- Gain access to time travel

See <u>Gaining Access to Time Travel</u> (obviously). This will probably take you at least a few years. If you are under the age of 18, you won’t get anything working until the age of 25. <i>(Ed: Can confirm.)</i>

Slow and steady wins the race here. You want to do this without getting arrested, causing house fires, or getting put on any watchlists. 

ALSO: during this time, take care of yourself. If you die in an accident, you won’t be able to fix it; be extremely careful while driving, performing house repairs, and consuming food/liquid. Cut back on your alcohol intake (and, if you’re in the 21st century, your sugar intake.)

DO NOT send the machine back to your past self. Ideally, you will have spent those few years maturing and thinking about your course of action. (You can make atemporal corrections; just be discreet.)

- Introductory experiments

A set of “basic” introductory experiments are listed first in the <u>Techniques</u> section. Work through them. This will corroborate the contents of this manual, prove that your machine is safe and operable, and teach you some basics. Also, time travel is really freaking cool, so it will be pretty fun.

This is a big milestone. Congratulations. 

- Set up failsafes

The <u>Techniques</u> section will help you here. You should, at minimum, create a <b>dead man’s switch</b>, a <b>bootstrap safeguard</b>, and at least one <b>deep-range research loop</b>.

- Go to ground

Hopefully you’ve already been executing a general strategy by this point, but in case you weren’t, start now.

Good luck.

<br>

<p align=center><u><b>Things to avoid</b></u></p>

- Sharing information with friends, family, and loved ones

Unless — and this is extremely important — you trust them to never tell anyone <i>under any circumstances</i>. You are gambling on not just their current self, but all possible versions of their future selves.<a class="footnote"><sup>7</sup><span>Spouses are especially dangerous.</span></a>

From experience, you should consider holding up under torture as a criterion.

- Location tracking, social media, excessive arpanet/internet/web sharing

Only really applicable if you make it into the late 90s or the 21st century. Self-explanatory.

- Winning the lottery

See <u>Appendix C – Making Money</u>. Plenty of literature on why this is a bad idea.

- Betraying any versions of yourself (past, present, or future)

Make a pact, right now, to cooperate fully and entirely with any version of yourself you may encounter. Follow that pact and trust other versions of yourself to follow it. This will save you time and headaches later.

- Cloning (unless you really, really, really know what you’re doing)

Despite what the previous thing said, you should avoid cloning — especially cloning yourself — because it has long-term logistical difficulties. (And if you’re going to clone yourself, you’d better remember to AT MINIMUM clone your passport, driver’s license, and credit card.)

Further update: DO NOT CLONE MONEY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

(See <u>Techniques – Temporal Cloning</u>.)

- Any sort of “time travel meet-up”

We know it’s very tempting, but you absolutely should not under any circumstances end up at one of these. Stephen Hawking’s one is the most famous, but there are others, and you should avoid those too. Don’t learn this lesson the hard way.

ADDENDUM: This is no joke. A future version of me apparently decided to check one out; future me ended up scrubbing ten years from my own timeline, and sent current me an extremely strongly-worded letter. Whatever series of events it caused, it must have scared the hell out of them, because some of the things they wrote... I’m not the kind of person to exaggerate. **STAY AWAY**.

<br>

<p align=center><u><b>Strategy</b></u></p>

Let’s get to the obvious question: *what are we going to do about it?*

<b>You need to put yourself in a position to act against potential enemy agents and extinction-level threats</b>. Everything else in your life is now secondary to this goal.

This is how you fight the time war. You are a deep, deep cover agent with your entire natural life as a cover story. Through the very possession of this manual, you have been granted a magnitude of power on the order of multinational CEOs, military generals, and mid-sized countries. <b>Assuming that proper recruitment protocols have been followed</b>, you can be trusted with this power. You can and should use this to benefit yourself, yes... but, likewise, this comes with a great deal of responsibility.

The nature of the threat constantly changes. As such, it’s impossible to predict what dimension the current conflict takes.<a class="footnote"><sup>8</sup><span>Though, given the contours of the 20th century, nuclear holocaust remains ever-present.</span></a>

Even so, <b>you need to be the right person in the right place at the right time to avert disaster</b>. It is obviously impossible to know what and where that is ahead of time. Your first goal is to work that out.

As long as you are not exposed, you can retry any major life choice and scout out any future event. You can embed yourself in companies, agencies, and even governments years before you need to operate there. It is common to dedicate decades of your life to one tiny adjustment. You will most likely find yourself in key positions of power. Be patient. Be cautious. Be exacting. <u><b>Do not get caught</b></u>.

If you had dreams, a career, or a life path worked out before reading this, then I am genuinely, truly sorry.

You have been given the keys to humanity’s survival. 

Don’t let us down.
