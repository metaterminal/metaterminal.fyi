My sophomore semesters were fairly bad for achievement - both in mischief and in other fields. I feel, for some reason, that the year got away. The relentless churn of time, bad circumstance, difficult people; take your pick.

But even so, one's nature (it seems) cannot be contained. There is a way of looking at the world, an askance observation: a desire, perhaps, for the world to have strange makings. College life is a crucible that burns away irrelevancies. But I *like* irrelevancies, and it hurts to watch them leave.

Thus you fight, every day. You fold happenings into seams of space-time and lace its collars with whimsy.

Some small vignettes, then. This time they're all about food.

### 1: The Tower

<!-- drinks? -->

### 2: The Five of Cups

<!-- olive oil -->

### 3: The Devil, Inverted

<!-- eggs -->
