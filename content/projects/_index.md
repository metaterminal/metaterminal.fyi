An index of projects from my time doing an undergraduate degree at Brown University -- all final projects for now. (Currently, my research either deals with sensitive data or is ongoing.) 

This is not a complete list. Not all my classes are in CS/engineering; not all of those have final projects; and not all final projects are interesting enough, or involve enough creative decisions on my part, to include. I am updating this page incrementally.

### Computer Science / Electrical Engineering

+ (Fall 2025) [Image Rendering for a 4-Color Dynamic E-Paper Badge](badge) (ongoing)
+ (Spring 2025) [A 95MHz 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V Processor](processor)
