An index of projects from my time doing an undergraduate degree at Brown University -- usually final projects, though not always. This is not a complete list. (Not all final projects are interesting enough, or involve enough creative decisions on my part, to include.) I am updating it slowly, mostly for the benefit of graduate admissions officers.

I've also put miscellaneous projects (which aren't puzzlehunts) in here.
