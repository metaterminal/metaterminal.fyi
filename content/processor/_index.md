This is a two-cycle pipelined RISC-V processor with a limited instruction set. I created this as part of my Design of Computing Systems (ENGN1640) class, which I took in my junior spring at Brown.

This document covers the general structure of the processor, the pipelining strategy I selected, and an example program (Sokoban). Sokoban was created in collaboration with my lab partner, Yash Vora.

Since this is still used as an assignment in this class (and I don't want Professor Reda to get mad at me), I will avoid talking about many of the low-level design decisions or actual RISC-V code! But here are the broadstrokes.

## General Remarks

This is a two-stage pipelined processor which handles the following RISC-V instructions: 

| Instruction | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| add  | Adds two registers and stores the result to a register. |
| addi | Adds a register and a given constant and stores the result to a register. |
| sub  | Subtracts one register from another and stores the result to a register.  |
| and  | Returns bitwise AND of two registers. |
| or   | Returns bitwise OR of two registers. |
| slli | Shifts a register left by some constant. |
| mul  | Multiplies two registers together and stores the result to a register. |
| sw   | Store a register to an address on the stack. | 
| lw   | Loads an address from the stack to a register. |
| beq  | Jump to a given instruction if two registers are equal. |
| bne  | Jump to a given instruction if two registers are not equal. |
| jal  | Jump to a different constant location in instruction memory. |
| jalr | Jump to a different location in instruction memory, dictated by a register (usually the stack pointer). |
| halt | (Not native RISC-V) Halt execution. |

Adding more instructions would have been fairly trivial; the limited instruction set was dictated by the professor.

Implementation of the processor was done through Altera's Quartus, a programmable logic device design software. Functionality was tested through deployment on an FPGA board.

### Timing Statistics

| Stat | Value |
| ---  | ---   |
| Max. Operating Frequency&nbsp; | 95MHz |
| Clock Period | 10.53ns |
| Duty Cycle | 20% |
| CPI | 1 (!) |

### Memory and Stack

The instruction memory can contain up to 2^32 - 1 instructions (although this can be readily extended). The first entry in instruction memory is hardcoded to be 0 and should not be overwritten (or undefined behavior will be observed). The first instruction should be written to the instruction memory location 1.

The stack contains 256 32-bit entries, placed at intervals of 4 words. Stack access must be word-aligned (that is, the stack pointer will access at multiples of 4.) If sp is not a multiple of 4, the value will get rounded down before access. The stack pointer (x2) is initialized to 1020, which accesses the last (255th) entry.

### Pipelining and Branch Resolution

Branch resolution occurs in the first stage (IF-ID-EX), bypassing the need for any fancy branch-decision logic or stage flushing. The program counter is always supplied with the correct next instruction within the first cycle.

The CPI is so low because the processor is only two-stage; unlike many other pipelined processors, the chip never needs to stall to avoid load-use or compute-use hazards. Writing from data memory into the register occurs before register reads, bypassing load-use hazards, and forwarding from the ALU output bypasses compute-use hazards. By sacrificing some frequency, we get an insanely fast CPI (equivalent to a single-cycle processor).

### Registers

Several registers are reserved for internal use or FPGA I/O:

| Register | Use |
| --- | --- |
| x1  | register address (ra) |
| x2  | stack pointer (sp)    |
| x27 | reserved for I/O (button 0 - "down") |
| x28 | reserved for I/O (button 1 - "up") |
| x29 | reserved for I/O (button 2 - "left") |
| x30 | reserved for I/O (button 3 - "right") |
| x31 | reserved for I/O (switch)   |

The last five registers are constantly updated by an I/O controller to reflect the status of the input devices, and can be referenced by the program.

### Writing to the Screen

Writing to the screen was handled by a VGA buffer module and video controller (which were supplied). A specific RAM module (with larger addresses than the stack) can be written to with an ASCII character and 12-bit RGB information, which would then be rendered by the controller based on a set of stored bitmaps.

## Floorplan

### Modules

The processor contains eight total modules:

+ Instruction Memory (instruction_memory): where the machine code for instructions are stored, and the program counter is stored and updated.
+ Control (control): where the control bits for other modules are set based on the current instruction.
+ ALU Control (alu_control): an additional control module for setting the ALU operation code.
+ Registers (registers): where the registers are stored.
+ Immediate Generation (imm_gen): where 32-bit immediate values are generated based on the current instruction.
+ ALU (alu): the arithmetic logic unit.
+ Data Memory (ram:data_memory): where the memory for the stack is stored.
+ I/O Controller (not pictured): polls the input buttons and switches, and sets reserved registers based on their current values.

Including a PLL (to generates the 95MHz clock with a 20% duty cycle from the FPGA's onboard clock), this makes nine modules. There are also various MUXes to select inputs for different modules based on control bits (set by the control module).

### Resource Consumption

(FIXME)

## Example Program: Sokoban

This is the example program written with a partner, Yash Vora. It's an implementation of the classic Japanese puzzle game Sokoban (倉庫番, meaning “warehouse keeper”), where the player pushes blocks around a level to get them onto specific tiles (referred here as “pressure plates”). A level is completed when every pressure plate is covered by a box. A player can push a box as long as the space behind it is empty (i.e. not filled with a box or a wall). This leads to surprisingly challenging levels and emergent gameplay! Our Sokoban contains three implemented levels, as an example; the assembly code can be readily extended to include arbitrarily many.

### Controls

Four buttons are used as movement; up, down, left, and right.

The switch is used a level reset; setting it to ON and then OFF again will reset the current level to its initial condition.

### Movement and Rendering

When a player attempts to move in a direction, the outcome depends on the tiles which are located in that direction. A tree diagram depicting the overview of the movement decision logic is below.

Sprites are rendered according to priority:

The top of the screen says SOKOBAN - LEVEL N, where N is the current level.

### Winning and Levels

A player beats their current level when every pressure plate is covered by a block. As currently implemented, each level has the same number of plates and blocks; however, it is theoretically possible for a level to have more blocks than plates, and indeed the current setup supports this. In that case, all the game requires is for every plate to be covered; not for every block to be on a
plate.

When a level is beaten, the game wipes the screen and then renders the next level for them to play. The player advances sequentially through levels (so level 1 first, then level 2, then level 3.) A winscreen is displayed after the second level (to demonstrate functionality); but hitting the reset switch on the winscreen will display more levels!
